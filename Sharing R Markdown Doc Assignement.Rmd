## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
my_map <- leaflet() %>%
addTiles() %>%  
addMarkers(lng=88.3639, lat=22.5726, popup="Kolkata - My City")
my_map 
```
